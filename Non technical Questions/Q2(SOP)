Hi I am Chaitanya from Civil department.
I am really eager to join AI community as it fascinates me a lot and obv around this time it's all about AI.
So as a student eager to learn AI use AI i wanted to join this community.
Though i don't know much about AI and code stuff (know only cpp due to CS101 and a bit python because of 12th boards( and by bit i mean very very litle))
Another reason being that i haven't done anything after coming in college ( not in any club nor tech teams ) i want to join this community.
I honestly have don't words to write in this purpose anymore as i think i expressed myself as much as could so that's it.
